# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# # Virtualized Feed React Application

This project is a React application that implements a virtualized feed for efficiently displaying various types of posts (images, text, videos, etc.). It includes features such as infinite scrolling, search functionality, scroll position preservation, and responsive design.

## Features

-   **Virtualized Feed:** Uses `@tanstack/react-virtual` for efficient rendering of a large number of posts.
-   **Infinite Scrolling:** Continuously loads posts as the user scrolls.
-   **Navigation and State Management:** Allows users to click on a post and view its details, preserving the scroll position when navigating back.
-   **Search Functionality:** Provides a search bar with debouncing to filter posts.
-   **Scroll Position Reset:** Resets the scroll position to the top on page refresh.
-   **Responsive Design:** Ensures the application works across different devices and screen sizes.
-   **State Management:** Uses React Context API for centralized state management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (>= 14.0.0)
-   npm (>= 6.0.0) or yarn (>= 1.0.0)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd virtualized-feed
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

2.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

1.  Build the application for production:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

2.  The production build will be located in the `build` directory.

-   `src/components`: Contains the React components.
-   `src/contexts`: Contains the React Context API provider.
-   `src/data.js`: Contains the mock post data.
-   `public`: Contains static assets.

### Dependencies

-   `@tanstack/react-virtual`: For virtualized rendering.
-   `react-router-dom`: For routing and navigation.
-   `axios`: For making API requests.
-   `lodash.debounce`: For debouncing search input.

### Addressing Vulnerabilities

After running `npm install`, you may encounter security vulnerabilities reported by `npm audit`. To address these:

1.  Run `npm audit` to see the detailed report.
2.  Try `npm audit fix` to automatically fix some vulnerabilities.
3.  If issues persist, especially related to `react-scripts`, manually update `react-scripts` to the latest version using:

    ```bash
    npm install react-scripts@latest --save-dev
    ```

4.  Thoroughly test your application after updating dependencies.

### Bonus Features (To Implement)

-   **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for images and videos using `react-lazyload` or `react-intersection-observer`.
-   **Theme Customization:** Add a theme switcher using CSS variables or a styling library.
-   **Offline Support:** Implement service workers and local storage for offline functionality.
-   **Accessibility:** Ensure accessibility with semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
-   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

### Deployment

To deploy the application, build the project using `npm run build` and deploy the contents of the `build` folder to your preferred hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or AWS S3).
