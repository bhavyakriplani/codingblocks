# # Virtualized Feed React Application

This project is a React application that implements a virtualized feed for efficiently displaying various types of posts (images, text, videos, etc.). It includes features such as infinite scrolling, search functionality, scroll position preservation, and responsive design.

## Features

-   **Virtualized Feed:** Uses `@tanstack/react-virtual` for efficient rendering of a large number of posts.
-   **Infinite Scrolling:** Continuously loads posts as the user scrolls.
-   **Navigation and State Management:** Allows users to click on a post and view its details, preserving the scroll position when navigating back.
-   **Search Functionality:** Provides a search bar with debouncing to filter posts.
-   **Scroll Position Reset:** Resets the scroll position to the top on page refresh.
-   **Responsive Design:** Ensures the application works across different devices and screen sizes.
-   **State Management:** Uses React Context API for centralized state management.

## Getting Started

    git clone <repository_url>
    cd virtualized-feed
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

2.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Building for Production

-   `src/components`: Contains the React components.
-   `src/contexts`: Contains the React Context API provider.
-   `src/data.js`: Contains the mock post data.
-   `public`: Contains static assets.

### Dependencies

-   `@tanstack/react-virtual`: For virtualized rendering.
-   `react-router-dom`: For routing and navigation.
-   `axios`: For making API requests.
-   `lodash.debounce`: For debouncing search input.

### Addressing Vulnerabilities

After running `npm install`, you may encounter security vulnerabilities reported by `npm audit`. To address these:

1.  Run `npm audit` to see the detailed report.
2.  Try `npm audit fix` to automatically fix some vulnerabilities.
3.  If issues persist, especially related to `react-scripts`, manually update `react-scripts` to the latest version using:

    ```bash
    npm install react-scripts@latest --save-dev
    ```

4.  Thoroughly test your application after updating dependencies.

### Bonus Features (To Implement)

-   **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for images and videos using `react-lazyload` or `react-intersection-observer`.
-   **Theme Customization:** Add a theme switcher using CSS variables or a styling library.
-   **Offline Support:** Implement service workers and local storage for offline functionality.
-   **Accessibility:** Ensure accessibility with semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
-   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

### Deployment

To deploy the application, build the project using `npm run build` and deploy the contents of the `build` folder to your preferred hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or AWS S3).
